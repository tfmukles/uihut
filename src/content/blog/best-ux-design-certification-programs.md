It's no secret that the demand for UX designers continues to grow. However, employers will look for those with an official UX qualification for employers to tell the difference between a self-taught or uncertified designer and one who has obtained a UX certification. If you're unsure whether you want to work in the UX field, a free [UX design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design) micro-course is an excellent way to find out. This course will give you a general introduction to the field and will help you determine whether it's right for you.

However, if you've taken your time and are still interested in UX design, then I'm sure you'll be curious about certification programs. These programs are just what you need as a self-taught designer! They'll teach you everything you'll need to know about the field and how to succeed in it. Of course, if you are currently working as a UX designer and have managed to become experienced without the help of any formal instruction, then maybe certification isn't the best option for you. If you're thinking about starting a career as a UX professional or looking to grow your skills and knowledge, this article may be of interest to you.

There are benefits to earning a UX certification. Certifications can offer a deeper understanding of the field, introducing you to new tools, best practices, and emerging trends. They also offer a chance to develop your skills with projects. The field of UX is fertile ground for people with a wide variety of skill sets. There are many different educational opportunities for people who want to build their human-centered design skills, and most come at different price points. A formal UX master's degree may be the right choice for some. Others may not need that level of education but can learn more through certification programs.

You could spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on certification programs on improving your UX designer career, but not all are worth the investment. To get to the best courses quicker, we've organized our selections in order from part-time courses and short-term courses to immersive programs, followed by full-time/long-term courses. To help you decide which course is right for you, I'll give you a short overview of the courses.
