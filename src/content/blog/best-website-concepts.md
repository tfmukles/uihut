## What Is A Website Design?

Website design is the process of creating websites. It covers everything from the initial planning stages through to the launch of the live site.

[Website design](https://uihut.com/web-templates) is a complex process, and there are some different concepts that every web designer should know.

## Why Is Website Design Important?

This is why website design is so important. Your website is the face of your business, and it's the first thing potential clients will see.

A well-designed website will show potential clients that you're a serious business with high standards.

So, if you're looking to make a good impression, make sure to focus on your website design.

## How To Create A Website

Creating a website might seem daunting, but it's not as difficult as it seems. There are a few basic steps that you can follow to get started.

The first step is to come up with a concept for your website. This might be a general idea or a specific theme or topic. Once you have a concept in mind, you can start designing the layout and creating the pages.

You'll also need to come up with a domain name and set up hosting. Once your website is ready, you can start adding content and promoting it online. There are plenty of resources available to help you with each step of the process, so don't worry if you're not familiar with web design.

## Examples Of Website Concepts

Some web design concepts that every web designer should know include a static website, a CMS-based website, an e-commerce website, and a custom [web application](https://uihut.com/web-apps). A static website is the simplest and most common type of website. It consists of a series of HTML pages that are loaded when a user visits the site.

A CMS-based website is more complex and allows you to manage your content yourself. An e-commerce website lets you sell products and services online. A custom web application is a bespoke application that's built specifically for your business. It can include features like a customer login system, an order management system, or a shopping cart.

**Here are 15 different website concepts to help you:**
