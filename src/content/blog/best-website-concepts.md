## What Is A Website Design?

This is why website design is so important. Your website is the face of your business, and it's the first thing potential clients will see.

## How To Create A Website

Creating a website might seem daunting, but it's not as difficult as it seems. There are a few basic steps that you can follow to get started.

The first step is to come up with a concept for your website. This might be a general idea or a specific theme or topic. Once you have a concept in mind, you can start designing the layout and creating the pages.

## Examples Of Website Concepts

Some web design concepts that every web designer should know include a static website, a CMS-based website, an e-commerce website, and a custom [web application](https://uihut.com/web-apps). A static website is the simplest and most common type of website. It consists of a series of HTML pages that are loaded when a user visits the site.

A CMS-based website is more complex and allows you to manage your content yourself. An e-commerce website lets you sell products and services online. A custom web application is a bespoke application that's built specifically for your business. It can include features like a customer login system, an order management system, or a shopping cart.
