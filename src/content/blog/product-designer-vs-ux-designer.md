When people think of a designer, they probably think of someone who is only responsible for making things look pretty. They may not realize that what they see is the result of customer research, a lot of testing, and usually some pivoting thanks to this testing. When most people look at a product, they rarely realize how much work it takes to turn a complicated idea into something a customer finds helpful

[Product design](https://uihut.com/designs/20230502125940mp_/https://uihut.com/all/Hosting-Web-Applications/22707) is a primary part of our everyday life. As most people have no idea what goes into the process, it’s safe to say they don’t know how to differentiate between a product designer and a UX designer.

However, we’re here to help. A lot of people struggle with the difference [between design and tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_and_Technology). Really, it cannot be easy for even experts.

Some companies also interchange the two. What’s the difference? And if you have just gotten started, how do you know which one might be best for you?

## What is Product Design?

![](</blog/What is Product Design.png>)

First of all, let’s give a product designer definition so we know what we’re talking about. What exactly is product design?

A product designer helps create new products for a company. Product design is a solution for a company that helps sell products or services and communicate with customers.

A product designer is someone who helps the process of creating a new product for a company. A product designer has to think about how a product will sell and communicate with customers.

A lot of people say that product management is focused on the market and development is focused on the customer’s technology needs.

But what about product design, what does that entail?

According to ProductPlan, a product designer has the responsibility of designing the user experience for a product, taking direction from product management on the business goals and objectives.

All in all, you can look at it as a constant loop of feedback. A designer brings together what the client wants with what will make them money (or not lose them money).

As a product designer, there are many responsibilities. First, you need to understand the business goals and needs.

Second, you must stick to the budget. And finally, you need to recognize and solve problems with the product. Product design covers user experience, marketing, and technical design.

In addition to these tasks, product designers are also involved in other related fields. Product design, at its core, is mainly focused on the business needs of a product.

Designing a product without consideration of the behavior of users will not be successful. Depending on business needs, goals, and growth strategies, the design will change.

## What is UX Design?

![](</blog/What is UX Design.png>)

UX design is in charge of the interaction between the user and the product. Business goals are important, but client satisfaction is the number one priority.

The main objective of UX design is to make interfaces that are practical, user-focused, and gratifying. For example, UX design always works with real customers.

User Experience (UX) design is the process designers follow when they want to create a product or a service.

The goal of UX design is to create something that users want. To do so, it must make life easier for the user while ensuring their experience is an enjoyable one.

User experience encompasses many aspects and uses a variety of skills such as product design, user acquisition paths, branding, usability, engagement, and functionality.

## Product Designer vs. UX Designer: What’s The Difference?

Product designers are responsible for both the function of the product and the user experience. They are tasked with deciphering the needs of both the business and the consumers while they work on the objectives.

◾ Who are the target customers? What will they use the product for?

◾ How can I make this product enjoyable and easy to use?

◾ How can I design the product so that it is visually appealing?

◾ How can I create the best version of the product that meets the various needs of my customers?

In the field of design, "UX Design" refers to someone with a UX-oriented design focus. UX Designers must balance the interests of users and the company.

Ideally, the UX Designer should be able to take user feedback to understand and satisfy their needs, while also delivering solutions that drive revenue, which is not always possible.

Project designers need to have a deep understanding of not only the customer but also the business.

They need to know what product managers, sales reps, and other stakeholders want, how they make decisions, and how to work with them. They need to know how to act both like a UX designer and more. UX design is not a singular role, it covers different areas and crosses organizational boundaries.

Depending on the company and what they are trying to achieve, the UX designer’s responsibilities may differ.

While any employee should be concerned about their organization's goals, the UX designer's primary responsibility is to ensure that the customer has a great experience with the product. So while User Experience Designers focus on the needs of the customers, Product Designers focus on both the customer and the company.

Product Designers are responsible for championing both parties and making sure that each has what they need.

They do UX, UI, coding, project management, and the most important part—problem-solving. They design solutions for problems that might arise during the initial process.

A product designer will create teams to deal with these problems, identify multiple test plans and wireframes, and go through A/B testing. The designer will also work with developers and marketers to ensure synergy between the product and the brand.

A product manager makes sure the company’s product is relevant, cost-effective, and functional. They also ensure the company’s stakeholders are happy with the product they help create.

## What Does A UX Designer Do?

Follow this with user testing and prototyping, you have a UX designer at its core.

## Final Thoughts

In this article, we have comparatively explored the difference between Product Designers and UX Designers to you. Product Designers are primarily concerned with creating a vision for the end user. UX Designers typically collaborate with that initial product designer and focus on how they will use the interface.

Just as is said in the beginning, both positions require proficiency in design basics and programs as well as soft skills such as communication, curiosity, and empathy. Both focus on problem-solving. If you search "Product Designer" in any search engine, you'll often get results for UX Designer or even "UX Product Designer."

There are many different types of designers in the world. User Experience Designers are concerned primarily with the customer journey. They may work with the business and engineering to build a product that has been closely tested to ensure it has an excellent user experience and flows well. Product Designers, on the other hand, have a deeper focus on both the customer experience as well as what is good for the business.
