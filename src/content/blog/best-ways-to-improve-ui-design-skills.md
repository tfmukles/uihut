Typography is one of the most important aspects of UI design. It can help create rank and contrast on a page, making it easier for users to navigate. When it comes to typography, it's important to consider both the font and the size.

For example, you might want to use a different font for headings than for the body text. You can also control the size of the reader to create significance and contrast. Just be careful not to go too small; users need to be able to read your text easily!

**Key concepts for typography design:**

* Style
* Font selection
* Size
* Leading
* Tracking and kerning
* Measure
