Dear Valued Customers,

We are writing to inform you about a significant disruption in our services due to an unprecedented situation in Bangladesh. Widespread student protests have resulted in a nationwide internet shutdown imposed by the government, starting on July 18th. This has affected our ability to provide uninterrupted customer support, respond to inquiries, and fulfill our commitments.

We understand the inconvenience this may cause and sincerely apologize for any disruption to your experience. Our team is committed to restoring normal operations as soon as possible. Although internet connectivity has been partially restored in certain areas, our office remains offline. To communicate this urgent announcement, we have temporarily accessed internet services from a co-working space.

We are closely monitoring the situation and hope to resume full operations within the next week.

Thank you for your understanding and patience during this challenging time. We appreciate your continued support.

Sincerely, <br />

Team UIHut
