User Interface (UI) development involves designing, creating, and implementing interactive interfaces for websites, applications, and mobile platforms. A UI developer ensures that digital interfaces are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and user-friendly.

Though UI developers and web developers share similarities, UI developers focus more on the visual design and user experience, while web developers concentrate on technical functionality and back-end development. A strong understanding of human-computer interaction (HCI) sets UI developers apart.

## **Difference Between UI Developer & Web Developer**

UI developers and web developers are two different types of developers that often get confused with each other. UI developers focus on the look and feel of a website, while web developers focus on functionality and back-end development. This article will explore the differences between UI Developers and Web Developers and help you decide which type of developer is best for your project.
